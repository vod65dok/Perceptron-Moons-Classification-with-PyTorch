# Perceptron-Moons-Classification-with-PyTorch
Perceptron Moons Classification with PyTorch

This project showcases the implementation of a binary Perceptron classifier using PyTorch. It highlights the challenges faced by Perceptrons in handling non-linear data by applying the model to the "moons" dataset. Key features include training the model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing its decision boundary to gain a deeper understanding of its capabilities and limitations.

# Overview

The project employs a simple Perceptron model to classify points from the "moons" datasetâ€”a commonly used synthetic dataset for classification tasks. The dataset is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets. The trained model is then evaluated on its ability to separate the two classes. A standout feature of this project is the graphical representation of the decision boundary, demonstrating the classifier's performance over the dataset.

# Features

Model Training: The Perceptron is implemented and trained using PyTorch, emphasizing simplicity and interpretability.
Custom Loss and Optimization: Training includes step-by-step calculations of loss and gradient updates using PyTorch operations.
Decision Boundary Visualization: Generates a visual plot showing the classifier's predictions across the feature space, making it easier to observe its behavior with non-linear data.
